Although we've created an example with artificial data, we think tackling this problem will teach you a number of fundamental data science skills. These include:

* dealing with under-specified questions
* data imports and preprocessing ("data wrangling")
* filtering and slicing data
* generating summary statistics using different basis-units

If this last item doesn't make much sense to you, you may be exactly the sort of person who would benefit from working through this challenge.

[detailed work through of a possible analysis of this data, and how it illustrates the importance of understanding different basis units, to come here]
<!--[Zahra: I am not sure if I get the meaning of basis-units; I added what I had prepared as the answer anyway! For now, they are in python; I will translate them to R code later.]-->

First, we need to import the data:
```

```
Then, let's take a look at the histogram of number of passengers per journey.
```
