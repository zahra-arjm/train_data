## The challenge

Passengers on City Trains complain that most journeys they take are too crowded. City Trains say that most journeys are less than half full. Who is right, and why?

## The data

Looks like this

![first rows of dataframe](head.png "The Data")

Each row reflects data on a particular journey. The variables in the columns are

>**train_id** - an ID code for the train taking the journey
>	
>**route** - the route
>
>**arrival_time** - the arrival time
>
>**passenger_id** - an ID code for the passenger taking the journey
>	
>**date** - the date of the journey
